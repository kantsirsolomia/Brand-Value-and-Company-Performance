# Brand Value and Company Performance
The hypothesis of the research is that companies with great brand value generate positive stock returns and show better performance on the market. It happens  marketing activities are reflected in stock prices and a company’s returns. 
I used the main performance measures that many investors are looking at before investing in the company. These are - ​ROI, P/E​, ​Market-to-book value, Earnings per Share, ROE. 
For hypothesis' validation I used the most popular companies with well-established brands. That were Apple, Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft, McDonald’s, Starbucks.
